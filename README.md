# TUI technical test solution
This repository contains the solution to TUI technical test.

**Developed by**: Emilio D. Clemente Silmi.

## Development environment
This project can be run with Docker, following these instructions.
1. Build the docker image
    ```
    docker build -t tui-app .
    ```
2. Bring up the container (replace <your_valid_key> with a valid Weather API key)
    ```
    docker run -itd -v `pwd`:/var/www/tui-app -e WEATHER_API_KEY=<your_valid_key> --rm --name tui-app tui-app
    ```  
3. Check that container is running
    ```
    docker ps -f name=tui-app
    ```
    
If the last command outputs something like this, then the development environment is ready to use
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
